# Catch - APP to make recommendation about plan B

## Inspiration
Unexpected weather changes, unforeseen restrictions, or the place is simply too pricey... 
Having experienced these changes, a bit too often especially during the pandemic, we are 
motivated to come up a solution that addresses this trend.

## What it does
Catch is a mobile app that helps users plan dates better by checking logistical problems.
It also suggests related date ideas, giving you plan b if things fall through.

## languages and Platforms
Java, Python, Tensorflow, Tensorflow Lite

Android Studio (build the mobile app), Google Colab (train the neural network)
